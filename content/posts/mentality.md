### Mentality
I just ate one beer, lost 2 games of Dota 2 and tomorrow the cat that was living with us will be taken back to his original owners. So I thought its exactly the time to write something about the importance of good mentality and key things I think crucial about this stuff that is called life and how we walk through it (spoiler, we should walk with the head held up high).

### Mentality means the way of thinking. 
Right now I'm 25 years old. I tried a lot of things, work related, life related, health related. I failed at a lot of things that I tried, actually at most of things. Things that I didn't fail at - I failed enough to learn stuff. Point is - A lot of losses, a lot of failures. Does it matter? Certainly not, at least when it comes down to my mentality. Because that's just how life is. In a way I am really trying to keep positive mentality no matter what, because at the end of the day (more accurate will be to say at the end of life) those little stresses here and there, and other things add up, and as the years go by your nerve system just suffers the consequences. In a way I am really trying to be sort of hip type of guy who learnt about stoicism but was too bored to read it through. I only know few points, but actually not from stoicism, it was just how I developed my own philosophy while growing up. 

### You should not worry about things that you can't control. 
In school after you wrote the test there is no real benefit of stressing about the results. It's just how it is. Especially when you know that you did not prepare enough. Exactly at the moment when I realized that I did not prepare enough I decided that "Whatever happens, happens". It was really helpful, from this simple analysis of the situation you can decide for yourself what to do. How does it help your mentality - you don't stress about the exam if you did not prepare. If you prepared and failed- you did not prepare enough. Such a simple formula but at the same time I feel omitted by so many people. Hello, its not only about exams, its about everything in life. There is action and a consequence. **If you don't control the action - you don't control the consequence**.

### People are very complex. If it doesn't work out - its okay, pal.
I never studied psychology. I talked to people who did. There is certanly a big benefit in this study because it all comes down to interactions between people, and their actions. But in general, people are very complex, and if you can't understand something 100% percent - don't worry about it too much. Yes you said something stupid, happens to anyone, don't go over analyze what is going to happen, you don't control what's gonna happen next. Also, there is chemistry involved, your's and another person's. some things are stupidly simple - eat and both of you will feel better and it's gonna be easier to make someone laugh for example, it really does work like that (in my experience). Drink alcohol and it's easier to talk, etc etc etc. But if it's not easy to talk, or it's not easy to laugh together, its alright. Maybe it's you, yes, you should spend some time and self reflect about your actions, have self control about what you say and what you do. Try to be objective.

### Try to find the one and only truth, even if it means that you are wrong.
I am a big believer in truth. That in conversation and in the argument there is the truth, the ultimate and only. Of course it's very arguable, but I do strive for that truth, I find it somewhat important. When you find it together with another person - that's your ground, and you can work your way to any direction together from that ground. It really is important.

### Be friendly and good. Don't expect Much in return
Maybe it's me, I like doing good things and it's fine if it does not come back. Sometimes I see this as a side quest. do something to another person, help someone. I guess this one is very close to stoic's idea to live as one with nature. In our concrete jungle nature - people and stuff around us. Clean your house, say something nice to someone on the street, etc.

### Conclusion
It was not really about mentality but some, I guess, rules that I follow..? But it's really just what helps me keep my mentality positive. I don't know. That's just very random topic that I thought about. I might update it in the future.
